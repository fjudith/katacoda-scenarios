# Install Sawtooth Packages

This exercise demonstrates how to configure the Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) algorithm.

The stack includes the following hosts:

host | services | status
---- | -------- | ------
`chsa-b2-00` | `validator`,`settings-tp`, `intkey-tp-python` and `rest-api` | Installed
`chsa-b2-01` | `validator`,`settings-tp`, `intkey-tp-python` and `rest-api` | Installed
`chsa-b2-02` | `validator`,`settings-tp`, `intkey-tp-python` and `rest-api` | Installed

The goal is to cover the complete steps required to setup a PoET enabled Sawtooth network.
