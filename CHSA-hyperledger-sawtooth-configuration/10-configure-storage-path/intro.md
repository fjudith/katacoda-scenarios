# Install Sawtooth Packages

This exercise demonstrates how to install the various storage directories in Hyperledger Sawtooth.

The stack includes only the following host:

host | services
---- | --------
`chsa-b10-00` | `validator`, `settings-tp`, `intkey-tp-python`, `xo-tp-python` and `rest-api`

The goal is to move all configuration files and data in the `sawtooth` home directory.
